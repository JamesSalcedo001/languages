fn main() {

    let __integer: i32 = 10;  // integer, notice the use of the i32 data type, which seems to be used for integers + similar to java or typescript in structure, also important note, Rust does not like unused variables so one must use the variable to get rid of error or add two underscores before the name
    let __float_num: f64 = 10.5; //float, note the usage of the f64 data type, it seems like it is used for floats
    let __string: &str = "Hello"; // string, note the usage of the &str, also do not forget semicolons!
    let __boolean: bool = true; // note the usage of bool 

    // variables

    let __variable: i32 = 10;
    const __CONSTANT: i32 = 20; // defined with const keyword
